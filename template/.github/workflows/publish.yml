# This workflow will publish or update articles on dev.to each time a new
# commit is pushed to the main branch.
#
# To make it work, you need:
# - A dev.to API key, see: https://docs.dev.to/api/#section/Authentication/api_key
# - A GitHub personal access token with the **repo** permission checked, see:
#   https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
#
# Once you have generated the tokens, you need to add them as secrets in your
# GitHub repository:
# - DEVTO_TOKEN: your dev.to API key
# - GH_TOKEN: your GitHub personal access token
# See https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets
# for more information about GitHub secrets.
